# JavaScript Basics Practice

Welcome to the JavaScript Basics Practice repository! This collection of files covers fundamental concepts and practical examples to help you learn JavaScript programming from the ground up.

## Introduction

This repository is designed for beginners who want to build a solid foundation in JavaScript. Each file focuses on a specific topic, providing clear explanations and practical examples to reinforce your understanding. Whether you're new to programming or looking to refresh your skills, these exercises will help you grasp essential JavaScript concepts effectively.

## Files and Topics Covered

1. **Variables and Data Types**: `variables_datatypes.js`
   - Learn how to declare variables using `let` and `const`, understand different data types such as strings, numbers, booleans, and more.

2. **Comparison Operators**: `comparison.js`
   - Explore comparison operators (`==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, etc.) and understand how JavaScript evaluates equality and inequality.

3. **Strings and Numbers**: `strings_numbers.js`
   - Manipulate strings and perform basic operations with numeric data. Learn about string methods and mathematical operations in JavaScript.

4. **Mathematical Operations**: `math_operations.js`
   - Master basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and explore useful math methods available in the `Math` object (`Math.sqrt`, `Math.random`, etc.).

5. **Arrays**: `arrays.js`
   - Understand arrays in JavaScript, including methods like `push`, `pop`, `forEach`, `filter`, `map`, and `reduce` for efficient data manipulation.

6. **Objects**: `objects.js`
   - Dive into object-oriented programming concepts in JavaScript. Learn how to create objects, access properties, and utilize methods for object manipulation.

7. **Functions**: `functions.js`
   - Explore the fundamentals of functions in JavaScript, including function declarations, function expressions, and how to pass arguments and return values.

8. **Scopes**: `scopes.js`
   - Understand variable scopes in JavaScript, including global scope, function scope, block scope, and how variable hoisting works.

9. **Arrow Functions**: `arrow_functions.js`
   - Learn about the concise syntax and benefits of arrow functions in JavaScript, suitable for writing more compact and readable code.

10. **Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)**: `iife.js`
    - Discover IIFE, a pattern in JavaScript for creating self-executing anonymous functions, often used to encapsulate code and avoid global namespace pollution.

11. **Control Flow**: `control_flow.js`
    - Master control flow statements in JavaScript, including `if`, `else`, `else if`, `switch` statements, and logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`).

12. **Truthy and Falsy Values**: `truthy_falsy.js`
    - Understand how JavaScript evaluates truthy and falsy values, crucial for writing conditional statements that behave as expected.

13. **Iteration**: `iteration.js`
    - Explore various methods of iterating over arrays and objects in JavaScript:
        - `for` loop
        - `while` loop
        - `for...of` loop
        - `for...in` loop
        - Array methods like `forEach`, `filter`, `map`, and `reduce` for efficient data processing.

## How to Use

Each JavaScript file in this repository is standalone and can be executed independently to see examples and test code snippets. To run a file:

   git clone https://github.com/Dhruv9099/JavaScript_Tutorial.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the file you want to run:

   ```
   cd JavaScript_Tutorial
   ```

3. Execute the file using Node.js:

   ```
   node filename.js
   ```

   Replace `filename.js` with the name of the JavaScript file you want to execute.
